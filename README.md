# botnet-attack-detection
This project detects botnet activities in IoT environments using machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, logistic regression, random forest, decision trees, and deep learning models like CNNs and RNNs. The UNSW-NB15 dataset is used for training and testing, with Random Forest and XGBoost achieving the best performance.
